/**
 * Rootless actors (#1251) and missing level templates (#1252), against a real editor.
 *
 * A plain Actor spawns with no root, so it has no transform. add_component_to_actor now makes a scene component
 * the root, move_actor refuses a rootless actor instead of reporting a move that did not happen, and attach_actor
 * names why an attach fails. create_new_level and load_level refuse a template or level that does not exist
 * instead of reporting a map they left unopened.
 *
 * Runs only against the dedicated disposable test project, on whatever map is open.
