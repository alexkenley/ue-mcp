/**
 * `editor(open_asset)` on the map that is already loaded (#1218).
 *
 * Opening a World loads it as the editor map, which destroys the map loaded before it. Asked for that same map, the
 * load destroyed the world the handler held under a GC scope guard, and the editor died on its world-leak check. The
 * handler now answers alreadyOpen without loading anything; the editor has to still be there afterwards.
 *
 * Runs only against the dedicated disposable test project.
